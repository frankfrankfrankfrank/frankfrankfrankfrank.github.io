  <h3 class="text-md">Why is the project important to me?</h3>
  <p>This was the first time I worked with other UX designers and engineers. I picked up new skills: data analytics, user interviews, qualitative user testing, and designing solutions with prescribed design system components.</p>

  <h3 class="text-md mt-4">The problem</h3>
  <p class="text-md mb-4">In 2014 The Motley Fool's payment screen was dated and ineffecient. I was tasked with solving for the high-number of user drop-offs on payment and the high-volume of customer service calls regarding processing.</p>

          </div>
      </div>
  </div>

  <h3 class="text-md mt-4">Discover</h3>
  <p>UX designers at The Fool were pretty siloed at the time, but we found each other and started sharing our work. Those new relationships enabled me to gather data and research from other projects to bolster my own. I conducted user interviews with more senior researchers <span>&#8212;</span> learning how to script a test, notate when you're not facilitating, and how to organize and present findings to the team and senior leadership.</p>

  <p>I worked with platform engineers to define requirements and constraints. I also listened to customer service calls to better understand user issues.</p>

  <h3 class="text-md mt-4">Develop</h3>
  <p>I gathered my personas, flows, and findings and prototyped proposed solutions in the code using our design system and platform components. I was able to test my ideas with customers at local Fool events and receive feedback that sharpened my work. I teamed with engineers to find a single-screen solution that worked with our payment system. Then collaborate with Sales, Leadership, and Marketing to bring more clarity to membership renewal.</p>

  <p class="text-md mb-4"> The UI solutions were fairly straight-forward (I had a ton of help from users). Navigating system limitations and departmental needs was more challenging. Ultimately, we found a single-screen solution that rendered payment, and added clarity with UI and instructional text updates.</p>

  </div>

  <h3 class="text-md mt-4">Validate</h3>
  <p>After the update was deployed payment completion increased by 30% and customer service calls concerning the payment screen decreased by 10%.</p>
