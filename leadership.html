              Good design leads to higher sales, more engagement and retention, and faster product cycles. Establishing a strategy of measuring and communicating UX success back to the team and leadership is a large part of being a UX leader.
            </p>
            <p class="text-light">
              I'm a big fan of data and answering questions with real numbers. By measuring the success of an experience, we can track if our solutions are working and/or where they need modification. This level of clarity not only benefits the organization but the UX team, as well. When everyone clearly understands direction and goals, it's easier for individual contributors to apply their skills to helping find solutions.
            </p>
            <p class="text-light">
              Aligning the UX team's talents and skills to tackle the most pertinent issues for the organization benefits the bottom-line. UX research helps uncover what's most valuable to the user, while leadership can steer the team in the right direction.

            </h2>
            <p class="text-light">
              A team with diverse backgrounds and talents fills gaps and reduces blind spots. Successfully building software and developing products today requires empathy, collaboration, and a willingness to shun ego to find the best idea at the table. A roomful of experts willing to listen and ask questions, then work together to test ideas based on user findings, removes the need to assume or simply guess what users want.
            </p>
            <p class="text-light">
              Successful teams are supportive and respectful <span>&#8212;</span> to each other, their colleagues, and the user. There will always be moments of discord and setbacks, but a team that practices working through differences together builds trust and resiliency.

              When I worked at The Motley Fool, we often talked about having a "Borg mentality" <span>&#8212;</span> we all can learn from one another's successes and mistakes. Sharing our work, removing silos, and remaining transparent across the organization opens individuals up to learning. It also enables individual lessons to be distributed throughout the organization.
            </p>
            <p class="text-light">
              Learning from one another, collaborating, and finding solutions that support user and organizational goals is the path to success <span>&#8212;</span> for the individual, for the team, and for the company.

              UX has many disciplines, from research to systems design. As UX continues to evolve, the field of specialists is expanding. I enjoy working with designers to help them find their niche. At the end of the day, we all want to have some knowledge of research, interaction and systems design. The more we understand the limitations and opportunities of other UX disciplines, the better colleagues we become.
            </p>
            <p class="text-light mb-0">
              Managing a UX team requires supporting  individual designers and researchers as they evolve in their practice. Cultivating an environment that inspires curiosity and innovation and communicating a clear strategy unleashes a UX team that can maximize impact for the organization.
