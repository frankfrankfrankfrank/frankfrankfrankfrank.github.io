              UX research helps discover what users find valuable, as well as what frustrates them. Data and user insights are valuable at every phase of the product cycle, but have the most impact when research is applied at the start.
            </p>
            <p>
              The early findings from user surveys, interviews, and lo-fi prototype tests can uncover potential issues and bugs that haven't been built yet, saving development and design time. This is great! Plus, you can see what ideas are working, and build from those learnings as you develop the product.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've also observed that people are more willing to share their opinion if the work appears unfinished. (Perhaps critiquing something that looks polished and complete could seem rude some.) Showing someone your messy work has its own set of rewards.
            </p>

              Discover
            </h2>
            <p>
              Whether you're updating an existing idea or starting a new one, the beginning is a great time to start talking with potential users. Qualitative research is great at this stage. Asking users open-ended questions or observing user tests helps when exploring new ideas. Again, it doesn't have to be anything fancy. Anything that gives the user an opportunity to provide feedback <span>&#8212;</span> a paper prototype, a script draft, or a Google Form survey with static images would work.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              The value in Discovery is not only generating new ideas, but also validating them. UX Research is about finding what's working, as well as what's not. Knowing as much about both sets you up for success as you move into the development phase.

              Once you're working in the code, you'd prefer the pivots to be minimal and few. At this stage, you're building screens with design system elements, updating and writing copy, and bringing the experience to life in the code. Using quantitive research can help tighten everything. For example, measuring time on task and error/success rates can help you choose between solution options or quickly validate new ideas.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the product comes together, UX Research should save development time and leave few questions to be answered as you ready to deploy version 1.0.
            </p>

              Validate
            </h2>
            <p>
              When the product is out in the world, data analytics and further user testing can help validate the success of the experience. Checking in with Sales and Marketing can shine a light on friction and success. After a successful launch, you're looking for any improvements that not only improve the product, but also scale to other ones.
