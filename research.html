              UX research helps discover what users find valuable, as well as what frustrates them. Data and user insights are helpful at every phase of the product cycle but have the most impact when research is applied at the start.
            </p>
            <p>
              Early findings from user surveys, interviews, and lo-fi prototype tests can uncover potential issues and bugs that haven't been built yet, saving development and design time. This is great! This process allows teams to discover and scale successful ideas as the product develops.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, people seem more willing to share their observations if the work appears unfinished. (Perhaps critiquing something that looks polished and complete seems rude to some?) Showing someone your messy work has its own set of rewards.

            </h2>
            <p>
              Whether you're updating an existing idea or searching for a new solution, a great first step is talking with potential users. Qualitative research - asking users open-ended questions or observing user tests - helps explore and validate new ideas. Again, it doesn't have to be anything fancy. All you need is something that gives the user an opportunity to provide feedback <span>&#8212;</span> a paper prototype, a script draft, or a Google Form survey with static images works. It's surprising the number of insights <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users" target="_blank" class="u u-LR text-body">five users</a> can generate.

            </p>
            <p class="mb-0">
              The value of Discovery is not only generating new ideas but also validating existing approaches. UX research is about finding what's working, as well as what's not. Knowing what to leave out as you move into the development phase is as valuable as knowing the good ideas. Why spend time and effort building a complex interaction if nobody uses it?

              Once you're working in the code, it's best to minimize major changes in strategy or design. At this stage, you're building screens with design system elements, updating copy, and bringing the experience to life in a staging environment. Using quantitative research can help tighten everything. For example, measuring time on task and error/success rates can help you choose between solution options or quickly test assumptions.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a product comes together, UX research will save development time and minimize guesswork as you ready to deploy.

              When a product is in the market, data analytics and further user testing can help validate the success of the experience. Checking in with Sales and Marketing can shine a light on friction and success. After a successful launch, you're looking for improvements that not only help the product but also scale to others.
