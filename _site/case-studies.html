  <p>UX Researcher / Front-end UX</p>

  <h3 class="text-md">Why this project is important to me</h3>
  <p>This was the first time UX Research was part of my process. I picked up new skills: data analytics, user interviews, qualitative user testing, and designing solutions with a prescribed design system and components. All which I still use today.</p>

  <h3 class="text-md mt-4">The problem</h3>
  <p class="text-md mb-4">In 2014 The Motley Fool's payment screen was ineffecient and confusing. I was tasked with solving for the high-number of user drop-offs on payment and the high-volume of customer service calls regarding processing.</p>

  <h3 class="text-md mt-4">Discover</h3>
  <p>Working with other UX designers enabled me to gather data and research from other projects to bolster my own. I conducted user interviews with more senior researchers <span>&#8212;</span> learning how to script and facilitate a test, notate when you're not asking questions, and how to organize and present findings to the team and senior leadership.</p>

  <p>I worked with platform engineers to define requirements and constraints. I also listened to customer service calls to better understand user issues.</p>

  <h3 class="text-md mt-4">Develop</h3>
  <p>I gathered my personas, flows, and findings and started wireframing. After a design review, I prototyped proposed solutions in the code using our design system and platform components. I was able to test my ideas with customers at local Fool events and receive feedback that sharpened my work.</p>

  <p>I teamed with engineers to find a multi-step solution that worked with our payment system (an engineer found a way to validate payment). Then I collaborated with Leadership, Sales, and Marketing to bring more clarity to membership renewal.</p>

  <p class="text-md mb-4"> The UI solutions were fairly straight-forward (I had a ton of help from users). Navigating system limitations and departmental needs was more challenging. Ultimately, we found a guided, multi-step solution that rendered payment, and added clarity with UI and instructional text updates.</p>

  <h3 class="text-md mt-4">Validate</h3>
  <p>After the update was deployed payment completion increased by 30% and customer service calls concerning the payment screen decreased by 10%.</p>

  <p>UX Director</p>

  <h3 class="text-md">Why this project is important to me</h3>
  <p>While at EVERFI, I led a team of designers, researchers, writers, and developers tasked with making our question and answer interactions more dynamic. We transformed a multi-select radio button experience that expanded multiple screens into an animated card game. The entire team leaned on UX Research from the start, and our solution was impactful and delightful.</p>

  <h3 class="text-md mt-4">The problem</h3>
  <p>A big part of online learning is assessments, but assessments can be tideous and the least exciting part of the experience. User testing revealed that many learners skimmed the questions and would often guess until they got the correct answer. There was little incentive to engage. Our team was tasked to improve the experience.</p>
