                      <h3 class="text-dark mt-4 mb-2">Why this project is important to me</h3>
                      <p class="text-dark mt-0">In 2018, Jeff Weiner, then CEO of LinkedIn, approached EVERFI to develop a product that taught compassion in the classroom.  His goal was to have every US student be able to define "compassion" and we had to find out from teachers and parents how best to do that.</p>
                      <p class="text-dark mt-0">Our internal LX and UX teams worked with an outside game design firm to craft an experience that would be easy for teachers to use in the classroom and would not require every student to have access to a computer.</p>

                        <p class="text-dark">After initially meeting with and surveying teachers we learned that most schools had a limited amount of student computers. Even though most teachers had a way of presenting videos in the classroom, the team needed to get creative and develop more than high-quality video games. Our initial findings revealed:</p>
                        <ul class="text-dark">
                          <li>
                            We needed to think beyond digital solutions,

                          <li>
                            The experience had to be seamless for teachers and the classroom, and

                          <li>
                            We needed to develop a strategy to measure success

                        </ul>
                        <p class="text-dark mb-6">The team went to work developing videos and digital games while exploring analog solutions like scenario-based card games and interactive posters for the classroom. </p>

                          <p class="text-dark">The team began working on games like the "Mindful Maze", a game that has students achieve goals while being mindful of their character's anxiety when encountering stressful situations. In the experience, simply stopping and breathing allows the player's "stress meter" to cool-off. Another game we called "Empathy Goggles" gave players an opportunity to explore other people's perspectives. These interactions gave students a sandbox to practice their social-emotional skills.</p>
                          <p class="text-dark mb-6">We knew we needed more than digital interactions. The LX team began developing offline lesson plans and materials to print and use in the classroom. One of these ideas was scenario cards that gave examples of opportunities to show compassion. These ideas allowed teachers to start discussions or put into action the skills the students were learning from the lessons.</p>
