              A UX team of researchers and designers can help discover what users find valuable, as well as what frustrates them. With these learnings in mind, the team can build, validate, and maintain a design system that removes friction and supports user success.

              <p>
                While at EVERFI I managed a team that built and maintained our design system, was consistently testing with our users, verified that we met WCAG standards, and communicated the system requirements and UX findings to the product development team.
              </p>
              <p>
                Working alongside developers, writers, product designers and leadership (it takes a village), our collective work made for better products, happier customers, and a more efficient build process.
              </p>
              <h5>
                Two UX Researchers walk into a library
              </h5>
              <p>
                One Sumer day, our Senior UX Researcher and I went to a library near George Washington University with our computers, a testing script, and $5 gift cards for the coffee shop next door. We were attempting to user test our latest product with college students in exchange for the gift cards, but the library staff turned us away.
              </p>
              <p>
                So we asked the staff at the coffee shop, and after some discussion, they said yes! For the next two months, we spent two hours every Friday user testing with our target audience as the product evolved. This was the first time we gathered outside feedback on our work, as we built it, not after, and it changed everything.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our senior researcher was able to report our findings back to the development team and rapidly get ahead of issues. I was able to distill the data and present the findings to leadership which allowed for a larger research budget.
              </p>
              <p>
                Near the end of my tenure, it took one-third of the previous time to build a product. Developers had built components and patterns that matched our design system that not only enabled rapid development, but allowed for more even user testing. The more we talked to our users, the sharper we got.
