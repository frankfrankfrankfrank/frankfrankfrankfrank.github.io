  <h3 class="text-md mb-1">Why this project is important to me</h3>
  <p class="mt-0">When EVERFI partnered with the <a href="https://truthinitiative.org" target="_blank" class="u u-LR text-body">Truth Initiative</a>, I led a team of designers, researchers, writers, and developers tasked with making a dynamic course that would speak to high school students about the dangers of vaping. Working with teens, we developed an experience and message that addressed the realities of addiction while revealing the marketing practices of vaping companies.</p>

  <h3 class="text-md mt-8 mb-1">The problem</h3>
  <p class="mb-8 mt-0">We measure digital learning efficacy with assessments, but assessments can feel tideous and stressful for a lot of users. Our research revealed that many learners skimmed question and answer text, and users guessing answers was not uncommon. There seemed to be little incentive for learners to engage. Our team was tasked to investigate and improve the experience.</p>

  <h3 class="text-md mt-8">Discover</h3>
  <p>User testing revealed the question and answer text to be too long in most cases, prompting learners to skim. The assessment section templates were originally designed for desktops. Threy would span multiple screens, often times requiring scrolling, and had no indication of progress. Our courses told a story and had characters, but the assessments didn't include those elements and took the learner out of the story. </p>

  <h3 class="text-md mt-4">Develop</h3>
  <p class="mb-8">Since we had a fully-developed design system that was mirrored in the code,we were able to prototype and test our ideas rapidly. After multiple-rounds of testing with <a href="https://www.swatflorida.com" target="_blank" class="u u-LR text-body">students</a> that inspired creative development, shorter text, and clear UI, we had a found a solution that was accessible, responsive, and fun.</p>

  <h3 class="text-md">Role</h3>
  <p>UX Director</p>

  <h3 class="text-md">Why this project is important to me</h3>
  <p>Inclusive design is always the goal. While at EVERFI, I worked with the VP of Accessibility, our Senior UX Researcher, and developers from <a href="https://makeitfable.com" target="_blank" class="u u-LR text-body">Fable</a> to test our design sytem components with people with disabilities. This research improved our component library and patterns while teaching us how to plan and build sophisticated interactions without sacrificing Accessibility.</p>

  <h3 class="text-md mt-4">Discover</h3>
  <p>After deciding to work with Fable, our first task was to decide were to begin investigating. Instead of testing individual products, we started with our design system components. </p>

  <p></p>

  <h3 class="text-md mt-4">Develop</h3>
  <p>I gathered my personas, flows, and findings and started wireframing. After a design review, I prototyped proposed solutions in the code using our design system and platform components. I was able to test my ideas with customers at local Fool events and receive feedback that sharpened my work.</p>

  <p>I teamed with engineers to find a multi-step solution that worked with our payment system (an engineer found a way to validate payment). Then I collaborated with Leadership, Sales, and Marketing to bring more clarity to membership renewal.</p>

  <p class="text-md mb-4"> The UI solutions were fairly straight-forward (I had a ton of help from users). Navigating system limitations and departmental needs was more challenging. Ultimately, we found a guided, multi-step solution that rendered payment, and added clarity with UI and instructional text updates.</p>
