              Design systems with components, styles, and patterns can accelerate product development. A scalable design system helps remove inconsistencies and redundant work while creating space for more elevated design thinking (hello UX Research).
            </p>
            <p>
              These systems become a shared language the team can lean on while building.
            </p>
            <p>
              Building a design system is not the end of the road. They require maintenance and updates. And benefit from feedback and research.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-lg">
              Discover
            </h2>
            <p>
              It all starts with the audit. Not only UI elements captured in design files, but the SCSS, the coded components, documentation, and instructional copy as well. This is also an opportunity to align the system to current accessibility standards.
            </p>
            <p>
              An audit of your current UI helps define design principles, direction, and strategy. It's not just about headers and buttons. This shared language includes language and tone, requirements, and process documentation.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-lg">
              Develop
            </h2>
            <p>
              Once you understand what UI elements and components your products need and your platform supports, you can begin updating and/or building with the prescribed visual styles. Creating consistency with type, color, spacing, components, and patterns extends the shared language the team created along to the user.
            </p>
            <p>
              Getting feedback on the design system comes from the internal teams, as well as users. The goal is to find the UI solution that scales, promotes consistency, and is accessible.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-lg">
              Maintain
            </h2>
            <p>
              The design system is an evolving product. As product needs, aesthetics, and accessibility guidelines change, the system needs to be able to adapt. If your products are using the system, and UX Research is part of the development process, you'll always have access to feedback.
            </p>
            <p>
              Just as design systems support research, by continuing to apply the discover, develop, and validate process to researching your system can help keep it fresh.
