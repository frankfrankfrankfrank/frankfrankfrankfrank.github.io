  <h3 class="text-md mb-1">Why this project is important to me</h3>
  <p class="mt-0">When EVERFI partnered with the <a href="https://truthinitiative.org" target="_blank" class="u u-LR text-body">Truth Initiative</a>, I led a team of designers, researchers, writers, and developers tasked with making a dynamic course that would speak to high school students about the dangers of vaping. Working with teens, we developed an experience and message that addressed the realities of addiction while revealing the marketing practices of vaping companies.</p>

  <h3 class="text-md mt-8 mb-1">The problem</h3>
  <p class="mb-8 mt-0">We measure digital learning efficacy with assessments, but assessments can feel tideous and stressful for a lot of users. Our research revealed that many learners skimmed question and answer text, and users guessing answers was not uncommon. There seemed to be little incentive for learners to engage. Our team was tasked to investigate and improve the experience.</p>

  <h3 class="text-md mt-8">Discover</h3>
  <p>User testing revealed the question and answer text to be too long in most cases, prompting learners to skim. The assessment section templates were originally designed for desktops. Threy would span multiple screens, often times requiring scrolling, and had no indication of progress. Our courses told a story and had characters, but the assessments didn't include those elements and took the learner out of the story. </p>

  <h3 class="text-md mt-4">Develop</h3>
  <p class="mb-8">Since we had a fully-developed design system that was mirrored in the code,we were able to prototype and test our ideas rapidly. After multiple-rounds of testing with <a href="https://www.swatflorida.com" target="_blank" class="u u-LR text-body">students</a> that inspired creative development, shorter text, and clear UI, we had a found a solution that was accessible, responsive, and fun.</p>
