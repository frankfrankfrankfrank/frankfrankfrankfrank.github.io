  <h3 class="text-dark mt-4 mb-2">Why this project is important to me</h3>
  <p class="text-gray-700 mt-0">By 2020, <a href="https://boingboing.net/2018/12/23/thank-you-for-smoking.html" target="_blank" class="u u-LR text-body">data</a> showed that vaping had erased decades of anti-tobacco progress with teens. Partnering with the <a href="https://truthinitiative.org" target="_blank" class="u u-LR text-body">Truth Initiative</a> in January of 2020, I led a team of designers, researchers, writers, and developers tasked with creating a dynamic course that showed high school students the dangers of vaping. Working with teens from <a href="https://www.swatflorida.com" target="_blank" class="u u-LR text-body">Students Working Against Tobacco</a> (SWAT), we developed an experience and message that addressed the realities of nicotine addiction and unmasked the marketing practices of vaping companies.</p>

  <h3 class="text-dark mt-8 mb-2">Project Details</h3>
  <p class="text-gray-700">Our findings revealed that most teens knew cigarettes were dangerous, but thought vaping was safe, even healthy. Also, few considered vaping addictive. With a course to build, a tight deadline, and people counting on us to get it right, we were able to deliver because we:</p>
  <ul class="text-gray-700">
    <li>
      Had a research-driven process
    </li>
    <li>
      Developed with design components
    </li>
    <li>
      Validated with customers and users
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="text-dark mt-4">Discovery</h3>
  <p class="text-gray-700">We met with the research team from Truth on multiple occasions to share data, create personas, draft surveys, and develop lo-fi content-focused prototypes to test. Our intitial findings were:</p>
  <ul class="text-gray-700">
    <li>
      Personal stories about addiction from peers resonated with teens
    </li>
    <li>
      Screens with long text blocks promoted skimming, reducing engagement and retention
    </li>
    <li>
      Interactivity promoted user engagement, but needed to be more than just delightful
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">This prompted the team to explore the parallels in the marketing practices of tobacco and vaping companies to help expose misinformation. We also worked with teens who were willing to share their nicotine addiction story with others. And we decided to rethink our assessment model and introduce a card game to measure retention.</p>

    <h3 class="text-dark mt-6">Development</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700">The team had developed two proven tools for building effective learning experiences:</p>
    <ul class="text-gray-700">
      <li>
        Courses that told character-driven stories
      </li>
      <li>
        A fully-developed design system that was mirrored in the code
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">We relied on these tools to rapidly prototype and test ideas with SWAT, inspiring creative development, shorter text, and clear UI. After multiple rounds of testing, we found a solution that was accessible, responsive, and fun.</p>
